                <p class="main-text">
                    Growing up, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the capabilities of technology without even knowing it
                    was called 'tech.' When I started this program, I knew nothing about the tech industry because I was
                    a total newbie. I chose ALT School over others because my interest isn't just to become a successful
                    software engineer, but also to have a smooth onboarding into the tech industry at large. I
                    identified ALT School as the perfect vehicle to put me in that direction. It's been over a month
                    into this program, and I believe I made the right decision in choosing ALT School.

                <p class="why">My Goals and Aspirations</p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    As I navigate through this program, I anticipate a transformative journey. At the program's
                    conclusion, my aspiration is to be well-equipped and prepared for the dynamic and competitive job
                    market. I hope to secure a well-paying position in the tech industry, one that not only sustains me
                    financially but also challenges and fulfills me intellectually. The journey isn't just about
                    technical proficiency but about gaining a deeper understanding of the industry's intricacies,
                    trends, and the larger technological landscape. I aim to be not just a participant but a contributor
                    to this ever-evolving field.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    It's important to acknowledge my starting point: a total newbie. But it's precisely this "blank
                    slate" status that excites me. I wish to measure my growth, not only in terms of knowledge and
                    skills but in the personal growth that comes from venturing into unfamiliar territories, tackling
                    challenges, and broadening my horizons.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Overall, the path ahead is uncertain, and there's a sense of anticipation for the adventure that
                    lies ahead. While I may not have all the answers, I'm excited to see what the world has in store for
                    me. I firmly believe that this program is a stepping stone towards a future filled with
                    possibilities, and I'm ready to embrace the wonderful adventure that awaits.
